	<h2> Personal Background: </h2>
	<p> 
	My name is Kwaseem Sameer Grady, but I go by “Q” since the beginning of my name sounds like a “Q” (Kinda like the ‘Kwanza’). 
It’s easier for everyone, especially when they don’t know how to pronounce my actual name. I’m 21 years old and was born in Philadelphia. 
I lived the first half of my life there. My family moved to Charlotte, NC to get away from the crime and bad environment. 
I never knew that the world looked better outside of the northern states because we had never been anywhere aside from there. 
Anyways, I enjoy working out (mainly calisthenics and running, I am no bodybuilder), sports, playing video games, making beats (only when “inspired"), 
and spending time outside of the house because I tend to get headaches from sitting inside or under air-conditioning. 
I am pursuing the Full Stack Developer path because I know Python and I will be best friends.
	</p>
	</li>
	
<li>
<h2> Academic Background: </h2>
<p> 
	I graduated from North Mecklenburg High School in 2019 and took a gap year to get and use my first car for college, but COVID killed those plans. 
I also took the time to better understand more about the broadness of Information Technology and what I wanted to do specifically. 
I started my journey at CPCC in January 2021 and it’s been great.
	</p>
	</li>

<li>
<h2> Background in this Subject: </h2>
<p>
	My background’s start point is the day I started at CPCC, unless we’re including me testing the waters of HTML and AWS after I graduated during my summer of 2019. 
If I remember correctly, none of that involved scripting. 
Thus, I’m pretty new to the subject but I am a problem solver and dedicate myself to what I’m interested in so it’s been a breeze for me.
	</p>
	</li>
	
<li>
<h2> Primary Computer Platform: </h2>
<p>
I have a MacBook Air and a Lenovo that I use to make music/beats or do certain things that I cannot do on iOS, 
so iOS and Windows are readily available to me.
	</p>
	</li>

<li>
<h2> Courses I'm Taking & Why: </h2>
<ol>
<li> 
PSY150 - General Psychology
	<div>
I’m taking General Psychology because:
	<ol>
		<li>I have no choice.</li>
		<li>Psychology is cool. Who doesn't want to know about why we 
      are the way we are and why we do certain things? I have a slight addiction to documentaries
    as well so I've always been one to soak up as much knowledge about others as I can.</li>
	</ol>
	</div>
</li>
<li> 
WEB215 - Adv Markup & Scripting
	<div>
I love scripting. Scripting is the problem solving that I love. I can spend days without really treating myself correctly as long as I get this problem solved (kinda horrible ain’t it?). 
I have done it many times. All that other HTML and building blocks stuff is easy for me. Making everything actually work/flow is what it’s all about, in my opinion. 
Scripting is the hardest part of it all, in my opinion, so I’m definitely looking forward to honing my skills a bit more. 
(P.S. I really need to learn how to make user input flow from one page to another. It’s driving me nuts.)

<h2> Funny/Interesting Item about Myself: </h2>
<p>
My dunks’ so crazy they call me Tiger Woods &#128170;! What does it mean? I don’t know, for real. 
I just blurt random stuff out but I’m just a funny and chill dude though, for real. For real.
